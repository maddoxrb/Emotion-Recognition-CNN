# Emotion-Recognition-CNN
Implements a convolutional neural network to classify images of faces into different emotion categories. 


# TODO: Aditya
- fix dynamic coding pages:
    - make it so that if it is less than 1000 pixels, the model accuracy and your accuracy components hide
    - update the model accuracy charts to cards that have teh size of teh piechart change with the image
    - make it so that the buttons are also dynamic and adjust with the size of the card
- make the right piechart fully functioning
- update the left piechart and connect it to the backend server calls
- create the backend server calls (skeletons)

# TODO: Maddox
- figure out how to host the backend 
- figure out how to deploy with the backend (including access tom images)
- update the final backend server calls
- finish the info paeg (show maddox the design for this)
    - basically a few different screen sides that have animations of show on scree
    - info of model traning, where data set is from, contact information too?
    - make it look cool without overcomplicatiint it or filling out the page
